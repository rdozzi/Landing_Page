# Landing Page Project

This project is the second project of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. It introduced me, the student, to introductory Javascript DOM manipulation features that dynamically change the webpage from the HTML and CSS templates provided by Udacity.

# Contributions

This repository is public and a user is free to fork and/or clone the project. As a student, i'm still pretty new to frontend web development so feel free to send pull requests and/or comment on ways to improve the code or my conceptual understanding of something you see in my code.

## Index

The index.html file contains the HTML skeleton initially provided as part of the project template. 

## Styles

The styles.css file contains the CSS skeleton initially provided as part of the project template.

## App

The app.js file contains all of the updated Javascript content and is the heart of the project. Minus initial comments provided as a guide to the student, all of the JS contents were added and refined over the course of the project. The contents start with definition of global variables followed by helper functions that are implemented as sub-functions for the "core" functions of the project. The core functions establish the main functionalities of the webage and are then called at the end.
